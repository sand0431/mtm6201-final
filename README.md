## Project Overview
As part of the User Experience Design course final project, this online portfolio was created. It presents a portfolio of rental homes, showcasing various houses, their attributes, and other important details. The portfolio's excellent style and responsiveness are assured by the use of the Bootstrap framework.

## Development Process
### 1. Planning
- **Research**: Conducted research on rental house websites to understand common design elements and user expectations.
- **Wireframing**: Created wireframes for mobile, tablet, and desktop views using Figma to visualize the layout and design.
- **Content Gathering**: Collected images, descriptions, and other necessary content for the properties.

## 2. Implementation
- **Setup**: Initialized a GitHub repository named 'mtm6201-final' and set up the project structure with folders for HTML, CSS, images, and other assets.
- **Collaboration of Bootstrap**: Utilized Bootstrap's grid structure, elements, and utilities to utilize the project's responsive design.
- **HTML & CSS**: To conform to the design requirements, the HTML structure was created and decorated using custom CSS and Bootstrap classes.
**Accessibility**: To improve accessibility, I made sure all HTML elements adhered to semantic norms and had the proper ARIA responsibilities.



## Challenges and Solutions
### Challenge 1: Responsive Design
**Problem**: Ensuring the site looks good and functions well on all devices was challenging.
**Solution**: Utilized Bootstrap's grid system and responsive utilities to create a flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Tested extensively on multiple devices to make necessary adjustments.
